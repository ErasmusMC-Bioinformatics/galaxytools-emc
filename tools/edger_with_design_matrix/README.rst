EdgeR wrapper for Galaxy
========================

This is a wrapper for the RNA-Seq differentially gene expression analysis tool EdgeR.
This wrapper contains 2 flavours of tests, a classical 2 group analysis and a more
sophistiacted multi-factor analysis.

Input data can be generated using so called count tools. The wrapper has been written
to be compatible with at least featureCounts (by yhoogstrate) and HTSeq-count (by iuc).

Implementation of EdgeR supporting quite advanced experimental
designs.
