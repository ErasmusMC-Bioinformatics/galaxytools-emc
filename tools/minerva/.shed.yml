  MINERVA API tools
long_description: |
  MINERVA (Molecular Interaction NEtwoRk VisuAlization) platform is a 
  standalone webserver for visualization, exploration and management
  of molecular networks encoded in SBGN-compliant format, including
  files produced using CellDesigner or SBGN editors. Visualization
  of uploaded networks generated by the platform is accessible via a
  web browser to all viewers with the weblink to the resource.
  MINERVA is a webservice using the Java Server Faces 2 technology.
  The server side, including data parsing, integration, annotation
  and verification, is implemented in Java 8. The platform uses the
  Postgres SQL database for data storage and the Hibernate framework
  as a middle layer between web server and database. The user 
  web-interface is generated using JSF and PrimeFaces. 
  The displayed content is visualized by OpenLayers or Google Maps API,
  dedicated JavaScript and CSS.
