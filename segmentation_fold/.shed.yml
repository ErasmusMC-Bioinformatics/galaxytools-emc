description: RNA-Folding including predefined segments including K-turns
long_description: |
  Segmentation-fold is a bioinformatics application that predicts RNA 2D-structure with an extended version of the Zuker algorithm. This modification contains a new "structure element" named a segment and is capable of folding a pre-defined substructure with multiple canonical or non-canonical pairings.
  
  This allows folding of more complex structures like the K-turns, which are also part of the implemented free energy tables. These thermodynamic parameters (free Gibbs energy levels) have been estimated using a computational approach and therefore lack accuracy.
